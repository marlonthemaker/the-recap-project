          From Progressive Field with a 10 mph wind blowing out, the Detroit Tigers defeated the Cleveland Guardians tonight with a final score of 3-0. Tarik Skubal pitched a gem for the Tigers, going 7 innings and allowing no runs, while Kerry Carpenter's 3-run home run in the 9th was enough to secure the win. The Guardians struggled at the plate failing to score against the strong performance of Detroit's pitching.
